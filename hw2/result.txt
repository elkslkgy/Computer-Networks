Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.

However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints.

Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.

Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.

Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer.

As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view.

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?

For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone.

Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth.

We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents.

I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view.

In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement.

I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges.

For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood.

    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view.

                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
There is no doubt that parents are the earliest teachers for almost each person. However, are they the best teachers? The answer might be yes sometimes, but not all the time. My reasons are as follows.

First of all, even though parents are already adults, they might have some bad habits. For instance, my father smokes a lot. Although he realizes that smoking is bad for our health and never smokes when I am around, he just can't help but smoke when he is alone. He had tried to quit smoking for many times before, but it ended up failing. Despite this disadvantage, my father is a great carpenter. He is good at making furniture(U), doing assembly work. In this field, he is definitely a nice and patient teacher.

Second, when we are in the elementary school or in the kindergarten, the lessons are relatively easy; therefore, parents can become a good teacher and teach us. Nonetheless, when we grow up gradually, the lessons become more and more difficult. Parents without high education or professional knowledge cannot teach us any longer. At this time, the professors in school are the better teachers than parents. Take my parents as an example. Both of my parents only graduated from junior high school because of poverty. As a consequence, I have already known that asking teachers at the school is always a better choice when I am confused by my lesson (about my schoolwork) since I was in my childhood.

To sum up, in spite of the fact that parents are not always the best teachers, they still play an important role in our life and have a great influence on us. No one could be the best teacher for good on earth seeing that no one is perfect and proficient in everything.


  Marks 22-25  A pretty good writing here.

We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized.

Question: 
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
I agree with the statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges. Universities and colleges are small societies which help students become adapted to the working field in advance. Learning new skills or absorbing new knowledge is important in this stage of life. However, cultivating good social skills is also essential. Seeing that Despite the fact that we have a lot of knowledge and ideas, we need good social skills to make ourselves understood. Without the key skills, we cannot communicate with others and put our opinions into practice. Therefore, an appropriate amount of money is supposed to be granted to support(finance) social activities. 
Besides, it is necessary for everyone to exercise regularly. Exercise can make people not only keep in shape but also be in a good mood. Whether at present or in the future, having a strong body will always do good to ourselves. For example, when the midterm exams or final exams are around the corner, some students with weak bodies will always be sick and do badly on the exams. Additionally, when faced with obstacles, we need enough energy and a strong body to deal with them. Playing sports in the universities is worthwhile since we can not only reach the purpose of staying fit but also learn how to cooperate with others. We learn how to work with others all the time when we are undergraduates, such as doing a final project in a group, playing 5-to-5 basketball with teammates. It goes without saying that teamwork is a necessity in the future. As a result, sports also play an essential part in our lives, and schools should pay more attention on this perspective and give enough financial support to it. 
To sum up, social activities and sports are as important as classes and libraries, and schools should strike a balance between both of them instead of turning a blind eye to them and depriving students of the rights to join sports events and social activities. 

Question:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:
    When it comes to the problem whether to tell the truth to other people, people may hold different points of view. Some people argue that being honesty or not should depend on different circumstances. Generally speaking, people should always tell the truth seeing that trust is the most fundamental element between people. No one wants to make friends with an acknowledged liar. On the contrary, an honest person can get along well with other people, and most people prefer to stay with people who have a good credit rather than socialize with people who tell lies all the time. However, in my opinion, I think that being an honest person should be a principle of my life for good. Under no circumstances will I tell a lie. The following are my viewpoints. Firstly, sometimes a person tells a lie to make his or her friend feel better when facing obstacles and feeling frustrated. However, this may not help him in deed but do harm to him. Despite the fact that soothing is important, I think telling him the truth and helping him figure out the solution to the problem are much more important than anything else. For example, my best friend failed the required course last semester. Some people soothed him that he had done his best and that he wasn’t at fault. In contrast, I told him that he prepared for the exams in a wrong way and helped him change his study habit. In the end, he passed the course with high scores. Not only he but also I am happy. Secondly, someone tells a lie in order not to hurt his friend or family. However, if the person finally knows the truth by himself, he is likely to be much sadder than knowing the truth directly in the beginning. Maybe it would be stressful and depressing when he finally gets to know the truth, but it would turn out to be a happy ending if you work hard and find a right way to solve the problem.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

With the accelerating development of technology, television plays a more and more important role in our daily life. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family; however, other people hold an opposite point of view. In my opinion, television hasn't made the generation gap between family and children deeper or communication among friends weaker, but strengthened the interactions between people.

Because of the growing popularity of mobile phones, it is a difficult task to find a person who doesn't have a smart phone. What's worse, people always glue their eyes on the screen of their phones whether sending messages to others or doing some shopping online. We tend to stare at the screen, getting along with someone far away from us or immersing ourselves in a virtual world, instead of talking to people who stay right with us or taking a look at the blue sky on a nice day and living in the moment. Fortunately, thanks to the televisions, people can watch TV, chat face to face with their family and have a whale of time together after a dog-tiring day. Take my family as an example, I watch TV with my family almost every evening. We watch all kinds of TV programs, such as the news, animation, soap operas, and so forth. When watching TV, each person pays their whole attention on the content of the program. We can't help but laugh out loud due to the funny scenes, discuss enthusiastically about the controversial issues broadcasted by the news, and compare the actor or actress who we like the most in an opera and the reason why we like him or her the most.

In a word, I disagree with the statement that television does harm to the relationship among family and friends. On the contrary, it makes people get closer and have a stronger relationship.

How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.

With the accelerating development of technology, it goes without saying that multimedia becomes an integral part of our life. Movies or television programs have an influence on our behaviors subconsciously.

First, news plays an important role in everyone's daily life, and some people even have a habit to watch the news on TV every morning. As a consequence, if the news always broadcasts something negative, it will make the society covered with a sheet of blues or negative emotions. What's worse, the negative news might cause other people to misbehave themselves. For example, if there is plenty of news talking about people who committed suicide, it will probably increase the suicide rate seeing that this kind of news makes an illusion to encourage people to do the same thing.

Second, imitation is human nature. Due to this human nature, people tend to imitate the actors or the actresses acting in the movies, especially children who are not able to know what can be done and what cannot be done. This innocence leads to a series of problem if children imitate the bad behaviors in the movies. Therefore, parents should be responsible for choosing appropriate movies or television programs for their children. Nevertheless, movies give a great number of lessons. For example, my favorite movie is "Finding Mr. Right", the main actor and actress taught me a lesson that the lonely ones wait for happiness, the lost ones search for happiness, and the content ones cherish happiness. This lesson has deeply affected me since I first watched the movie.

In a word, movies and television influence people's behaviors without our consciousness. As a result, it is important for us to keep thinking when watching movies or televisions. We need to keep thinking whether the behavior is bad or good, whether it can be imitated or not, and the deep meanings behind the screen which the directors wanted to tell us.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer. 
I live in Bali in New Taipei City, which is close to the confluence of Danshaui River and Taiwan Channel. If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would like to build an MRT station in my neighborhood.

It is not so convenient in my hometown in spite of the fact there are plenty of people living there. Someone might argue that it's impossible seeing that the government always build an MRT station when the population of a place lives up to some extent. For example, it doesn't use to have an MRT station in Luzhou. While it's entirely different now after the government ends up realizing that the growing population in Luzhou. Then, why isn't there an MRT station in Bali now? From my point of view, the reason is that the expense of constructing an MRT station there is too high since there are only two ways to set up the railroads. One approach is to build a railroad across Danshaui River which definitely costs a lot. The other one is to build a railroad extended from Luzhou Station; however, it's quite far between these two places.

I've been annoyed by this problem lacking of an MRT station since I was in my childhood. I need to get up early in the morning and take the bus which drives through the Guandu Bridge by myself. In addition, the most annoying thing is not getting up early in the morning, not carrying heavy schoolbags squeezed like a sardine on a crowded bus but waiting in line under the sunlight for a long time and turning out that I cannot take the bus when it finally arrives. Lots of people in Bali have to take a bus whether to school or to work and the bus stop is the last one before the bus gets up to the bridge; therefore, the bus is already full of people and not able to carry any person at all.

In conclusion, if I could change a thing in my hometown, the problem of mass public transportation will flash into my mind in no second. With an MRT station, people will have more choice, and the traffic won't get stuck during rush hours.

A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppose the factory? Explain your position.

If there is a company announcing that it wishes to build a large factory near my community, I would definitely oppose this idea. In spite of the fact that building a factory brings some advantages to my neighborhood, such as job opportunities, it also brings about pollution on my homeland.

First of all, it goes without saying that a large factory provides us with plenty of opportunities to have a job and earn money, which makes people capable of supporting their families. The project about constructing a large factory not only decreases the unemployment rate but also makes people be able to work in their neighborhood. There is no need to travel far away to a prosperous city to make a living.

On the other hand, a huge factory might cause irreversible damage to my community. For example, if the factory is a nuclear power plant, it will release a high level of radiation which does harm to people's health despite the protective measures done by the factory. Otherwise Furthermore, (What’s worse,) nuclear waste and high heat caused by a nuclear power plant are also essential problem which must be taken into consideration. Even though it's not a power plant, a factory might lead to other pollution, such as air pollution by emitting harmful gas, water pollution by pouring chemical waste into nearby rivers, and so forth. Last but not least, the manager of the factory might also exploit the employees in the factory with an eye to making more profits. After all, humans are all selfish.

Owing to countless disadvantages and few advantages, I am opposed to the project to build a factory in my neighborhood. I would rather go a little bit further to search for a job and commute back and forth every day rather than work in a factory which pollutes my homeland and does harm to my family. Without good health, life is worth nothing. To me, without my family, life is worth nothing as well.


                                good argument

It has been said, "Not everything that is learned is contained in books." Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?
 
Well goes the proverb that not everything learned is contained in books. We have kept learning since we were born. We study all kinds of subjects in schools, such as Chinese, math, English, science, and so forth. With the accelerating development of technology, knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and becomes more and more difficult to learn in a short time. In addition, we also learn plenty of things by experience. For example, we learn how to love others by getting along with others.
 
We can gain a lot of knowledge by reading a wide variety of books. They can be textbooks, novels, or even comic books. There must be something which authors would like to emphasize and desire to pass it down in their books. Otherwise, As a result, books are always worthy of being read seeing that it they contains things which are worthwhile to be learned. Knowledge gained from books is always about academic fields. However, knowledge gotten from experience is about life. By means of making friends with others, dealing with problems between among people, we learn how to love others, how to make build an appropriate relationship with others, and so on.

From my point of view, it's my belief that knowledge from experience is much more important than that from books. My reasons are as follows. First, it's inevitable to get along with others as long as we still lead a life on earth. In addition, human are creatures which tend to live together and do not want to stay alone. At this time Therefore, making friends with others is an essential ability. Second, knowledge in books can also be learned by experience. On the contrary, knowledge gained from experience cannot be drawn from books.
 
In a word, life could be tough, but we can learn how to deal with all obstacles and barriers by with the knowledge we learn from books and experience. If you do not want to read books, keep living right in the moment and enjoy your life. Experience will also give you plenty of lessons.

Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
People today prepare their meals much more easily than ever before. To prepare a dinner, housewives had to work for hours in the past. They had to buy some dirty vegetables which need washing, meat which needs to be sliced, and so forth. Each step of preparation mentioned above was a time-consuming task. But now, things are entirely different. Vegetables and meat are provided clean and neat, which takes people of modern days less time to prepare a delicious meal.

With food becoming easier to be prepared, people spend less and less time on three meals. That is to say, people have more time to do other things, such as studying, specializing in their professional fields, and so on. Besides, easily-prepared food offers people who are incapable of cooking a rather easy way to deal with their meals. For instance, I am a typical person who doesn't know how to cook. To me, instant noodles which not only are delicious but also save lots of time are the greatest inventions.

On the other hand, owing to those instant or easily-prepared foods, it deprives people of their quality time at which they can spend with their family. For example, in the past, it was common to see that Mother and her kids or her husband spent some time preparing meals in the kitchen together, having a whale of time. Nonetheless, now there are plenty of frozen food which takes less than half an hour to heat up sold in the supermarket. As a consequence, people tend not to help in the kitchen because preparing food becomes so easy and fast that it doesn't even need help. On the other hand, due to the popularity of fast food, people tend to become overweight and lead an unhealthy life.
All in all, nowadays, food has become easier to prepare, which has changed the way people live. However, it is hard to say whether this change does good or harm to our human seeing that the change brings advantages and disadvantages at the same time.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
Obviously, parents are the earliest teachers people have in most cases, generally most concerned about the development of their children. However, it is not true to say that parents are the best teachers. 
First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have some bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be a disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy everything including bad habits from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. We observe that some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop a prearranged direction. Ironically, when their children do not follow the instructions, the children will be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. 
Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are perhaps capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. Nevertheless, the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than has ever been before. No parent is able to be proficient in all fields though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. 
Nonetheless, parents may help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children to education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. On the other hand, parents might do their children harm more than do bad teachers as well. The nature of those children whose parents have divorced are often severely distorted. In a word, it is rather superficial to simply say that parents are the best teachers.

現在的工作學習比之前忙很多。如果給你a small amount of time你會選擇哪一件事情去做，以及為什麼。用具體的原因和例子去論證

With the accelerating development of the technology, people lead a life with fast pace. Here is most people's daily schedule: jumping out of the bed in time every morning, having a breakfast in a hurry, chasing after the bus or the MRT, and walking fast in order not to be late for school or for work. People always complain that there isn't enough time to do everything, and so do I. If I have a small amount of time, I would like to cook some fine and healthy food for myself at home.

Cooking meals myself is healthy for me. Seeing that I need to study at school the whole day on the weekdays and do a part-time job on the weekends, I seldom have the luxurious time to eat at home. I usually have my meal in a convenience store or at a street vendor. If I cook food myself, I can handle what I eat, how much salt I put in a dish, and make sure that I have a balanced diet which contains enough nutrients for me. In addition, I can cook what I love and don't need to worry about anything I don't like to eat showing up on my plates. Therefore, cooking food myself definitely attracts me the most in my free time.

Cooking food at home is quite comfortable and relaxing. I can wear my pajamas and my slippers with my hair like just being bombarded by a bomb. Besides, the most important thing is that I don't need to put on my makeup. When I eat out, I have to pay attention to my table manners, such as sitting properly, having my meals politely even though I am so hungry that I can finish five bowls of rice.

All in all, cooking food at home is healthy for me and makes me feel at ease. Hence, they are the reasons why I would like to pick cooking up without second thought if I have a small amount of time.
